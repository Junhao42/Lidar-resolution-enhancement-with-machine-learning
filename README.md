# Lidar-resolution-enhancement-with-machine-learning
This repository houses the code and resources for my final degree project, which focuses on enhancing Lidar sensor resolution through deep learning techniques in an image superresolution approach.

The data used for this project has been obtained from **The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite** and a new dataset from **Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería de Sistemas Informáticos (ETSISI)** specifically made for this project, which will be publicly available for future works.

- KITTI data can be found through the following link:

  ```

- ETSISI data can be found through the following link:

The ```data``` folder contains examples of point cloud data and images from the ETSISI dataset. Due to copyright related issues, KITTI data should not be uploaded outside of its oficial domain, in order to use its data it is advised to visit KITTIs oficial website.
